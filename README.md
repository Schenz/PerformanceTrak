## Performance Improvement

### Strategic & Long-Term Incentives
Utilize our platform to create data dashboards and scorecards for individuals and groups throughout an enterprise or multi-channel organization. Managers can examine analytics that will show performance trends and identify top performers or groups, as well as individuals who require performance interventions. Your data and content is presented “one-to-one”, delivering the right amount of information to each individual based on their business role, goals, and current status of performance attainment.
### Tactical & Short-Term Incentives
While strategic programs serve the long-term organizational objectives, sometimes short-term tactical programs are needed to help achieve specific, immediate business needs. With Tactical Builder, managers can quickly and easily create and manage short-term programs, track employee progress and improvement, and incentivize individuals through rewards and recognition. These turnkey programs will motivate your sales and service teams to improve their performance while contributing to the overall goals of the organization.
## Peer-to-Peer Recognition
Recognition at the peer level is one of the best ways to boost productivity internally. Empowering employees with the tools to recognize others and be recognized on-the-spot for a job well done lets them know their daily efforts aren’t going unnoticed. Research shows that employees who feel recognized are more apt to produce better results and remain loyal to the company.
